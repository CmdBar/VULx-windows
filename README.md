# VULX (Windows)

VULX is a Python-based desktop shell that runs on top of Windows — similar in concept to a desktop environment or how Android runs on Linux.

It provides a custom desktop experience with:
- User accounts
- Apps & games folders
- Settings and customization
- A Windows-like interface built entirely with Python and Tkinter
